<h3>Lucy</h3>
<p>
    Lucy is a 2014 French science fiction film directed by Luc Besson. The film questions the powers and limits of what a person can achieve if this ratio increases, based on the pseudo-theory that a normal person can use 10 percent of their brain.

<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>
    In Clarke's words, "The only masterpiece that can be compared to The Lord of the Rings is fiction." The series, when considered as a whole, contains magnificent sociological, psychological and philosophical analyses and observations on human nature; institutions of religion, politics and economy; the concept of leadership; and concepts such as man, woman and sexuality.
